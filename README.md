# AutoPylot
AutoPylot project by Autonomobile !

## How to setup the software

first clone the repo, then install the package and it's dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Autonomobile/AutoPylot.git
cd AutoPylot
pip install .
```
usefull tools:
- setup a python linter (we use flake8) : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting
- setup the test extension of vscode : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing
- use a docstring generator for example the vscode extension "Python Docstring Generator"

## Why this project 

Autopylot was born as an end of the school year project. Our school asks from it's student to take part in an project with a group of 4 students. We are free to create our own project, but it has to be accepted by the school's board, Autopylot was !!!
Being able to work on this project means we will be able to understand how tomorrow's car will work. Moreover, we will learn valuable skills in Python and in neural networks.

Our main objective is to make our car race against other cars and win the race !
This will require multiple intermediate milestones:

 - Being able to send scripted controls to the motor and servo.
 - Being able to drive the car manually using a controller.
 - Develop a way to gather images and annotations and store them in a stuctured way, for example sorted by date.
 - Process those data before feeding them to the neural network.
 - Being able to train a convolutional neural network using those data.
 - Build a telemetry web application.
 - Tweak the architecture and the parameters of the chosen model to acheive the best results.
 - Test in real life the model.
 - Race against others !
 - WIN !
